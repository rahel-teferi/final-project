## Introduction
The Library Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the process of managing a libraryâ€™s inventory, book lending, and user management. It provides an easy-to-use interface for librarians and users alike to manage books, view availability, and keep track of borrowed items. This system allows for efficient handling of book checkouts, returns, user registrations, and extending return dates.
